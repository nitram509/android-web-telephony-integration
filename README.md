Android Web Telephony Integration (WTI)
==================================================

Web Telephony Integration (WTI) is like Computer Telephony Integration (CTI),
but for the Web ;-)

This is a proof of concept (PoC) of how to integrate mobile phones
into a web application. 
This demo app is based on Android, but can be ported to iOS too.

This PoC is powered by [Firebase - THE REALTIME APP PLATFORM](https://www.firebase.com/)
